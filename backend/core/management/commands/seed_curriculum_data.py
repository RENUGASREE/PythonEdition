    explanations = {
        "variables": {
            "Beginner": "In Python, a variable is a **name that refers to a value stored in memory**.\n\nUnlike some other languages, Python is **dynamically typed**, which means:\n- You don't need to declare a type (int, string, etc.)\n- The type is automatically determined at runtime",
            "Intermediate": "Variables in Python act as **symbolic names** that are references to objects. Python's dynamic typing means the variable itself has no type, but the object it points to does.\n\nKey behaviors:\n- Reassignment changes the reference, not the object itself\n- Multiple names can point to the same memory address",
            "Pro": "Python variables are entries in a **namespace dictionary**. Understanding the difference between 'name binding' and 'assignment' is critical for optimizing memory and performance.\n\nDeep dive:\n- CPython uses reference counting for memory management\n- The `id()` function reveals the memory address of the object a variable points to"
        },
        "input_output": {
            "Beginner": "I/O is the 'conversation' between the user and the computer. You use `input()` to listen and `print()` to speak.\n\nKey points:\n- `input()` always returns a string\n- `print()` can combine multiple values",
            "Intermediate": "Python's I/O involves **Standard Streams**. `print()` writes to `sys.stdout` by default, while `input()` reads from `sys.stdin`.\n\nKey patterns:\n- Using f-strings for clean output formatting\n- Casting `input()` to `int` or `float` for calculations",
            "Pro": "Professional I/O utilizes **Buffered Streams** and asynchronous patterns. In high-load environments, we avoid the overhead of `print()` in favor of the `logging` module or direct stream writes.\n\nConcepts:\n- Standard Error (`sys.stderr`) for fault reporting\n- Non-blocking I/O for scalable network services"

## Common Mistakes
- { "Forgetting to update the variable value" if level == "Beginner" else "Using global variables unnecessarily" if level == "Intermediate" else "Ignoring memory overhead in large data structures" }
- { "Using incorrect naming conventions" if level == "Beginner" else "Not handling edge cases in input" if level == "Intermediate" else "Ignoring the Global Interpreter Lock (GIL) limitations" }

## Best Practices
- Use descriptive, **snake_case** names.
- Keep functions small and focused.
- { "Add helpful comments" if level == "Beginner" else "Follow PEP 8 guidelines" if level == "Intermediate" else "Write unit tests for core logic" }

## Mini Challenge
Head over to the **Challenge** tab to apply these concepts in our interactive code editor!

## Knowledge Check
1. How does Python handle the data type of a variable?
2. What happens to the memory when a variable is reassigned?

## Pro Tip
{ "Python is readable like English - keep it simple!" if level == "Beginner" else "Use `help()` to explore any object's methods." if level == "Intermediate" else "Use `__slots__` to save memory in classes with many instances." }

## Definition
{title} is a core Python concept and programming mechanism used to express application behavior reliably and securely.

## Why it matters
This mechanism is foundational in application codebases, optimization paths, and scripting operations. Correct implementation guarantees predictable state execution.

## Concept Explanation
{topic_explanation}

## Mental Model
Visualize {title} as a deterministic transformation pipeline. Input state goes in, operations are applied, and predictable output is returned.

## Code Example
```python
{topic_code}
```

## Real-world use
Engineers use this concept extensively while structuring backend APIs, cleaning arbitrary user data, and enforcing application state consistency.

## Common mistakes
- Misunderstanding the underlying behavior resulting in side effects.
- Skipping edge-case validation for undefined states.

## Best practices
- Write expressive, self-documenting syntax.
- Contain state mutations and utilize strict scoping whenever possible.

## Knowledge check
1. How does Python enforce predictability when using {title}?
2. What edge cases must be accommodated during the implementation of {title}?
